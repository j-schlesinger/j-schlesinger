# Iâ€™m @j-schlesinger
I am a PhD student at the National Institute of Genetics in Japan researching plant bioinformatics. My research centers around analysis of secondary metabolite production, but I have projects ranging from data compression tools to epigenetic analysis.

Feel free to contact me directly for questions or collaboration requests. For any discussion regarding research projects, please file an issue on the associated project.
